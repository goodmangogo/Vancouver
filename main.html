<h2>Everywhere Else But Vancouver</h2>
<p>
  "Vancouver is North America's Third Biggist film city. Perhaps no other city has been as thoroughly hidden<br /> from modern filmmaking as Vancouver, my hometown. Today, itâ€™s the third biggest film production city in North America, <br />behind Los Angeles and New York. And yet for all the movies and TV shows that are shot there, we hardly ever see the city itself."
